**Generalized random forests with fixed-point trees**: Accelerating generalized random forests using the fixed-point method (see [our new preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11908)  for details!). The modifications of the [``grf`` package](https://github.com/grf-labs/grf) used for our simulations could use a rewrite as it contains an embarassing amout of (now redundant) tests, comments, tangents, etc. It would most definitely do our work some good if I can clean up the implementation & produce something public-facing.
